# Machine-Learning-Session-4
IMBd dataset

### Summary
The objective of this session is to use a neural network for a sentiment analysis task on the IMDb dataset. Through this excercise I intend learn to classify movie reviews as positive or negative, based on the text content of the reviews.

### In Detail
I will be using the IMDb dataset, a set of 50,000 movie reviews labeled as positive or negative. This dataset is widely used for training and testing in the domain of sentiment analysis and serves as a benchmark for new models.

During the excercise I first vectorize my data, converting a sequence of words into a one-hot vector. After that, I then proceed by developing a deep learning model, where I test some of the multiple parameters of the model such as the use of proper activation functions, the stack layers and more. 

### Objectives
Understand the basics of sentiment analysis and its importance.
Explore and preprocess the IMDb dataset for neural network training.
Build and train a neural network to classify movie reviews.
Evaluate the performance of our model and explore ways to improve it.
